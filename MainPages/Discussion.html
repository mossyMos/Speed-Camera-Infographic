        <h2>Testing assumption</h2>
        <p>In the beginning of the project, the assumption was that the cause of crash is only through speeding and eliminate other factors however, it is clear that speeding isn’t the only variable responsible for serious car crashes.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The evidence collected confirms my original hypothesis that there is a correlation between the Speed Camera’s and the amount of serious car crashes, such that, the more speed camera’s there are, serious car accidents will decrease further. The graphs show serious and fatal car crashes reducing in the Victoria and have a downward trend, and other graphs/ evidence shows speeding infringements decreasing. Through this we can see that there is a clear relationship between the two variables.
        Although there is a Correlation, it does not imply causation. It cannot be determined if the decline in serious car crashes is caused by higher number of speed camera’s or other safety protocols followed by the Australian Government. There are many other factor that could be responsible such as a decrease in drink driving or a decrease in usage of mobile devices when driving.
        To investigate this further, we need to eliminate other factors that could contribute to lower car crashes as to improve the accuracy of the results and reduce the assumptions being made on the situations and the drivers.
        I would say this project was a success as the hypothesis was confirmed through the collected evidence.
