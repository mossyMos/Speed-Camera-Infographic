    <article id="hypothesis">
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>You are far more likely to avoid fatal accident, number of deaths and serious injury to all road users such as pedestrians, bike riders, car passengers and drivers in Victoria due to more speed cameras being installed because they discourage drivers from driving faster than the speed limit and follow traffic signals out of fear of getting a fine and those that have been charged before are more likely to be caution of a second offense and are safer</p>

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>This Project is aimed to prove the hypothesis by investigating the relationship between more speed camera to reduced road accidents. It will cover how speed cameras affect the relationship between speeding and car accidents, it will show the trends and patterns. The project will not provide data for specific cameras and how each camera performs individually. The project is limited to Australia only.</p>

        <ul class="a">
            
            <li>Incorrect data could be viewed as true and hence provide false information</li>
            <li>The project must be acceptable at a year 12 standard</li>
            <li>Time limit - Project must be completed before due date</li>

        <h2>Research Question</h2>
        <p>Road accidents have many different causes with many different situations. Different sources claim different things such as drink driving, falling asleep on the wheel, using technology while driving etc. Of course those have an effect on the number of car crashed however there’s no denying that speeding is also one of them. In the Cameras saves lives page “road trauma” they show an animate visualization showing the likely hood of fatality from speeding in which it presents that at 44 km/h, risk of death of pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists is 50% while at 56 km/h it is at an incredibly high 90%. This brings up the question, how serious is speeding and how much is there should be concern for this matter. This is why I choose the topic of speed cameras vs road accidents to see how safe our roads really are.</p>
