		<h1>Speed Camera</h1>
        <p>Increased speed means not only an increased risk of crashing but also increased severity if a crash occurs. Speeding is a big issue in road safety and one that is very challenging to fix. I'm curious to see how the measures taken by the Australian Government affect the issue of speeding in an everyday scenario. One major action taken by the Government was installing many speed cameras throughout Australia over many years to discourage speeders from risking their and others lives. In this project, I aim to find if speed cameras have in fact achieved their goals. </p>
